This project was created when I was learning React. It is divided into several branches, each of which focuses on a specific technology: React, Redux, Next.js, and so on. More detailed descriptions of each can be found below.

- ### Components
  Project setup (Vite, ESLint, Prettier, Husky). Choosing an API and creating a simple application to work with it. Handling errors. Using hooks is prohibited at this stage.
- ### Routing
  Implementing hooks and rewriting all components from class-based to functional. Implementing routing using React Router. 
- ### Tests, Context API
  Adding context to control application global states. Writing the first tests using Vitest and React Testing Library.
- ### Redux, RTK
  Integrating Redux, setting up Redux store and reducers using Redux Toolkit. Implementing RTK Query to make API calls and cache the results. Updating tests to accommodate the changes introduced by Redux and RTK Query.
- ### Next.js, SSR, SSG
  Migrating the application from Vite to Next.js. Migrating the router from React Router to Pages API.
